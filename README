xcopy userspace test repo
-------------------------

Introduction
------------

This repo contains a bunch of stuff for testing the p2pdma based xcopy
work [1].

Setup
-----

As well as this repo you will need two things:

1. A xcopy enabled Linux kernel. The source for this can be found here
[2] while a config that works for this kernel and qemu can be found
here [3].
2. Three QEMU image files. The first should be an OS image file and
you can use the scripts folder in [4] to generate that. The other two
are for the NVMe image files and can be constructed using qemu-img.

Once you have these things you can run the xcopy test executiable on
QEMU via the following steps.

1. Build the bzImage for the Linux kernel using [2] and the config
file in the configs folder of this repo.

2. Boot up the QEMU VM using the kernel from step 1 and the images
mentioned above.

2. Build the xcopy executable in this repo on either the host or
inside the QEMU guest.

3. Ensure filesystems are setup on the two fake NVMe SSDs exposed via
QEMU.

4. Use dd and /dev/urandom to place a file on the filesystem on
/dev/nvme0n1.

5. Do something like: ./xcopy <file from step 4> <output file on other
NVMe SSD>.

Assuming all the above steps go as planned you should see some
information in dmesg regarding the read and write and the output file
should not be a copy of the input file.
